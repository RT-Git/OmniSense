# OmniSense

A simple IoT implementation for providing remote access to sensor data. The project utilises a RaspberryPi to connect to a pressure sensor used in oceanic buoys deployed by the National Institute of Ocean Technology. The OmniSense android app connects to a server, which relays commands between the RaspberryPi and the app, allowing users to effectively read data from the sensor or even reprogram it remotely from any Android Phone
